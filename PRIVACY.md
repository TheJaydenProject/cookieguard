# Privacy Policy for CookieGuard

**Effective Date:** January 7, 2026

CookieGuard is an open-source browser extension designed to provide visibility into cookie activity. We believe in complete user sovereignty and data privacy.

## Data Collection
**CookieGuard does not collect, transmit, or share any user data.** * **No Remote Telemetry:** The extension has no analytics, tracking, or "ping home" functionality.
* **No External Servers:** All processing, risk classification, and analysis happen locally on your device (Client-Side).
* **No Third-Party Sharing:** Since we do not collect data, we have no data to share with third parties.

## Local Data Storage
The extension stores data locally in your browser's `storage.local` and `storage.session` APIs solely for the purpose of functionality:
* **Cookie History:** Logs of cookie events are stored to populate the "History" tab. This data never leaves your browser.
* **Settings:** User preferences (e.g., theme, muted domains) are stored locally.

## User Rights
You have full control over your data:
* **View Data:** You can view all stored data in the extension's dashboard.
* **Clear Data:** You can clear your history and settings at any time using the "Clear History" button.
* **Export Data:** You can export your local data for your own records.
